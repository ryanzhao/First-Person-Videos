This GitHub repository documents the entire creation process of our project. It includes first-person videos that comprehensively showcase how we designed and built every aspect of the project ourselves. These videos serve as a valuable review tool for us. When a prototype fails to work or encounters issues, we can refer to the footage from the development process to pinpoint the root cause.

Given the project’s massive scale and the significant time we devoted to it, it’s hard to believe at first glance that we conceptualized and constructed everything entirely. As such, these videos also serve as strong evidence of the project’s originality and authenticity, proving that no part of it was outsourced.
